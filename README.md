ALthough you would no this but you have to listen because I AM TELLING YOU....
<H3>Rule of this games are:<H3></H3><br>
1.) Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.<br>
2.) Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.<br>
3.) The goal is to achieve three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).<br>
4.) If the grid is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.<br>
5.) The first player to complete a row or achieve a draw wins the game.<br>
